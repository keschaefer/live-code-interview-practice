#React Live Code Challenge

Welcome to this React live code interview practice!

To get started follow these steps:

1. fork and clone this repo to your machine
2. run `npm install` in your terminal
3. run `npm start`, you should see the app live in your browser

Now you're ready to begin coding! This excercise is designed to last for about one hour. The goal is to implement the list of challenges below within the existing framework of this code base.

1. Render an ordered list of the wildflower names
2. Create an input field that allows the user to search the wildflowers based on common name. Your rendered list should update based on the search showing only those result that match. (case insensitive)
3. Utilize the `Card` component to render the flower list. You can leave the styling as is in the card, but style the page so the cards show as a grid rather than a list.

_Stretch_

1. Utilize the `Header` component. Move your search input to this component, retain it's functionality.
2. Create a dropdown menu in the header with five options Yellow, Purple, Pink, White, Blue, that when selected show only those flowers that match that color.

##Tips

Remember, for most actual live code challenges the goal is not to finish every single challenge (though that is certainly a bonus!), but to write clear, concise, well thought out code, all the while communicating to your interviewer what you are doing and why.

When all else fails, keep talking! Explain to your interviewer what is stumping you and how you might go about solving this problem and getting unblocked. Most interviewers will allow you to search for solutions online, developers in the wild do this about 1000x per day, so utilize that and just be mindful of explaining the process of your search. Try your best not to copy and paste solutions into your code if you can.

You can also focus on pseudo code if you get stuck. Write out the steps in plain English to solve your problem, then go through and try to code out each step one at a time. You've probalby done this before when you've solved a problem on your own and it's a great fall back in a coding interview. This demonstrates your ability to slow down and rationalize through a problem even when you don't know the solution right off the bat.
